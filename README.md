# Quest Manager
This is a Quest Manager template project created for the Project II course at UPC - CITM. The project is designed to help developers integrate a new module for controlling missions in their C++ project using SDL. The module reads mission data from an XML document, allowing for a wide variety of missions with various parameters.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Quest Manager, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the project in your preferred C++ IDE. Once the project is open, you can begin customizing the Quest Manager to suit your needs.

## Prerequisites
Before using the Quest Manager Template, you will need to have SDL installed on your system. If you don't have SDL installed already, you can download it from the official SDL website (https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).

## Usage
The Quest Manager Template is designed to be customizable to fit a variety of different project requirements. To use the template, you can modify the existing code to suit your needs or add additional functionality as necessary. The XML file used to store mission data can also be modified to suit your specific mission requirements.
